# Review Elixir PR

Follow the `Instructions` below to perform a comprehensive code review of an Elixir pull request, focusing on code quality, readability, maintainability, Elixir/OTP best practices, Phoenix/Ecto patterns, and style guide compliance.

## Variables

branch_name: $1 (required - the git branch to review)
pr_number: $2 (optional - the GitHub PR number for additional context)

## Instructions

1. **Setup & Context**
   - If `branch_name` is provided, run `git fetch origin` and `git checkout <branch_name>` to switch to the branch
   - If `pr_number` is provided, fetch PR details using `gh pr view <pr_number>`
   - Run `git diff origin/main...HEAD` to see all changes in the branch
   - Run `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline` to see commit history
   - **CRITICAL**: Read the actual changed files to get exact line numbers and code context

2. **Deep Code Analysis - REQUIRED**
   - **You MUST read the actual source files** that were changed using the Read tool
   - For EVERY issue found, you MUST provide:
     - Exact file path (e.g., `lib/my_app/services/email.ex`)
     - Exact line number(s) where the issue occurs
     - The actual problematic code snippet from the file
     - Detailed explanation of what's wrong and why
     - A concrete code example showing the fix
   - Do NOT provide generic feedback without specific file locations and code examples

3. **Invoke Elixir PR Reviewer Skill**
   - Use the `elixir-pr-reviewer` skill to perform a comprehensive code review
   - The skill will analyze:
     - Code quality and readability
     - Maintainability and testability
     - Elixir/OTP best practices and idioms
     - Phoenix framework patterns (if applicable)
     - Ecto query and schema patterns (if applicable)
     - Style guide compliance (Elixir formatter)
     - Pattern matching and functional programming best practices
     - Supervision tree design
     - Test coverage and quality

4. **Review Focus Areas**
   - **Readability**: Clear function names, proper use of pattern matching, pipeline operators
   - **Maintainability**: Proper module organization, clear boundaries, testability
   - **Modern Idioms**: Elixir 1.14+ features, proper use of `with`, `case`, pattern matching
   - **Goal Achievement**: Does the code accomplish its intended purpose effectively?
   - **Pattern Consistency**: Uses existing codebase patterns (Phoenix contexts, Ecto changesets, etc.)
   - **No Regressions**: Changes don't break existing functionality
   - **Anti-patterns**: Avoid improper error handling, blocking operations, inefficient queries, etc.
   - **OTP Principles**: Proper use of GenServers, Supervisors, and other OTP behaviors

5. **Testing & Validation**
   - Run tests: `mix test`
   - Check code formatting: `mix format --check-formatted`
   - Run static analysis: `mix credo` (if configured)
   - Run dialyzer: `mix dialyzer` (if configured)
   - Check test coverage if configured: `mix test --cover`

## Summary

**Total Issues:** {count}
- 🔴 Blockers: {count}
- 🟠 Major: {count}
- 🟡 Minor: {count}
- ⚪ Nitpicks: {count}
```

## Severity Definitions

- **blocker**: Critical issues that prevent merging (broken functionality, test failures, supervision tree issues)
- **major**: Important issues that should be fixed before merging (maintainability problems, missing tests, inefficient Ecto queries)
- **minor**: Issues that should be addressed but don't block merging (minor code smell, missing typespecs)
- **nitpick**: Style or preference issues (formatting, naming conventions, documentation)

## Elixir-Specific Considerations

- **Pattern Matching**: Proper use throughout, especially in function heads
- **Error Handling**: Proper use of `{:ok, result}` and `{:error, reason}` tuples
- **Pipeline Operator**: Appropriate use of `|>` for readability
- **with Statements**: Proper error handling in multi-step operations
- **Ecto**: N+1 query prevention, proper use of preloads, efficient changesets
- **Phoenix**: Proper context boundaries, controller simplicity, view logic separation
- **Concurrency**: Proper use of Task, GenServer, and other OTP behaviors

## Critical Requirements

- **MANDATORY**: Every issue MUST include exact file path and line number
- **MANDATORY**: Every issue MUST include the actual problematic code snippet
- **MANDATORY**: Every issue MUST include a concrete fix with code example
- **MANDATORY**: Read the actual files to get real code, not just diffs
- Do NOT provide vague or generic feedback
- Do NOT skip line numbers or code examples
- Focus on actionable, copy-paste ready suggestions
- Consider the broader codebase context and existing patterns
- Prioritize issues based on actual impact to users and maintainers
- Be thorough, specific, and constructive in feedback
- Consider Elixir community conventions and best practices

## Example Issue Format

Good example (Ecto):

```markdown
### 🟠 MAJOR: N+1 Query Problem in get_users_with_posts
**File:** `lib/my_app/accounts/user.ex:67`
**Category:** ecto

**Current Code:**
```elixir
def get_users_with_posts do
  users = Repo.all(User)
  Enum.map(users, fn user ->
    Map.put(user, :posts, Repo.all(from p in Post, where: p.user_id == ^user.id))
  end)
end
```

**Problem:**
N+1 query problem - fetching posts separately for each user results in N+1 database queries (1 query for users + 1 query per user for their posts). With 100 users, this creates 101 separate database queries.

**Impact:**
Severe performance degradation with large datasets. Response time increases linearly with the number of users. Under high load, this can lead to database connection pool exhaustion and application timeouts.

**Suggested Fix:**
```elixir
def get_users_with_posts do
  User
  |> Repo.all()
  |> Repo.preload(:posts)
end
```

**How to Fix:**
1. Remove the `Enum.map` and manual query loop
2. Use `Repo.preload(:posts)` to fetch all posts in a single JOIN query
3. Ensure the `:posts` association is properly defined in the User schema
4. This reduces 101 queries to just 1 or 2 efficient queries

```

Another good example (Phoenix):

```markdown
### 🟠 MAJOR: Business Logic in Controller
**File:** `lib/my_app_web/controllers/user_controller.ex:23`
**Category:** phoenix

**Current Code:**
```elixir
def create(conn, %{"user" => user_params}) do
  user = Repo.insert!(%User{email: user_params["email"], name: user_params["name"]})
  render(conn, :show, user: user)
end
```

**Problem:**
Business logic in controller - direct Repo access and manual struct creation violates the Phoenix context pattern. There's no validation or error handling, and the controller is doing too much.

**Impact:**
Violates separation of concerns, makes testing difficult, bypasses validation completely, and has no error handling for invalid data or database errors. The application will crash on invalid input.

**Suggested Fix:**
```elixir
def create(conn, %{"user" => user_params}) do
  case Accounts.create_user(user_params) do
    {:ok, user} ->
      conn
      |> put_status(:created)
      |> render(:show, user: user)
    {:error, changeset} ->
      conn
      |> put_status(:unprocessable_entity)
      |> render(:error, changeset: changeset)
  end
end
```

**How to Fix:**
1. Move Repo logic to the Accounts context module
2. Create `Accounts.create_user/1` function with changeset validation
3. Handle both success `{:ok, user}` and error `{:error, changeset}` cases with pattern matching
4. Use proper HTTP status codes (201 for created, 422 for validation errors)
5. Keep the controller thin - it should only handle HTTP concerns, not business logic
