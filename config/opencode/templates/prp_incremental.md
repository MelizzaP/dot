name: "Incremental PRP Template"

## Purpose
Template optimized for AI agents to implement features incrementally through continuous execution loops, with anti-oversimplification guardrails and strict validation requirements to achieve working code through iterative atomic progress.

## Core Principles
1. **Atomic Progress**: Each iteration completes ONE verifiable task
2. **Evidence Required**: No progress without test execution proof
3. **State Persistence**: Track progress between iterations in .state/
4. **Anti-Masturbation**: No self-congratulation without concrete results
5. **Validation First**: Test before declaring completion
6. **Global rules**: Follow all rules in CLAUDE.md
7. **Use Subagents**: Leverage the Task tool with appropriate subagent_type for complex operations

## Goal
[What needs to be built - be specific about the end state and desires. Unambiguously define acceptance criteria.]

## Why
- [Business value and user impact]
- [Integration with existing features]
- [Problems this solves and for whom]

## What
[User-visible behavior and technical requirements]

### Success Criteria
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcomes]

## Iteration State Management

### State Directory Structure
```bash
.state/
├── current_task.txt          # ID of task in progress
├── completed_tasks.txt       # List of completed task IDs
├── iteration_count.txt       # Current iteration number
├── task_manifest.yaml        # Complete task list with status
└── iteration_[N].log         # Log for each iteration
```

### Task Manifest Format
```yaml
tasks:
  - id: "task_001"
    description: "Create data models"
    status: "pending|in_progress|completed|blocked"
    validation_passed: false
    test_output: ""
    completed_at: ""
    blocked_reason: ""

  - id: "task_002"
    description: "Implement API endpoint"
    depends_on: ["task_001"]
    status: "pending"
    validation_passed: false
```

## All Needed Context

### Documentation & References (list all context needed to implement the feature)
```yaml
# MUST READ - Include these in your context window
- url: [Official API docs URL]
  why: [Specific sections/methods you'll need]

- file: [path/to/example.py]
  why: [Pattern to follow, gotchas to avoid]

- doc: [Library documentation URL]
  section: [Specific section about common pitfalls]
  critical: [Key insight that prevents common errors]

- docfile: [PRPs/ai_docs/file.md]
  why: [docs that the user has pasted in to the project]
```

### Current Codebase tree (run `tree` in the root of the project)
```bash

```

### Desired Codebase tree with files to be added
```bash

```

### Known Gotchas & Library Quirks
```python
# CRITICAL: [Library name] requires [specific setup]
# Example: FastAPI requires async functions for endpoints
# Example: This ORM doesn't support batch inserts over 1000 records
```

## Implementation Blueprint

### Data models and structure
```python
# Examples:
#  - orm models
#  - pydantic models
#  - pydantic schemas
#  - pydantic validators
```

### Atomic Task List (ONE per iteration)

```yaml
Task 001:
  id: "task_001"
  description: "Create base data model"
  atomic_scope: |
    - CREATE src/models/feature.py
    - Define single model class
    - Add type hints
    - NO additional features
  validation_required:
    - "mypy src/models/feature.py"
    - "python -c 'from src.models.feature import Model'"
  estimated_time: "5 minutes"

Task 002:
  id: "task_002"
  description: "Add model validation"
  depends_on: ["task_001"]
  atomic_scope: |
    - MODIFY src/models/feature.py
    - Add validators to existing model
    - Test validation logic
  validation_required:
    - "pytest tests/test_model_validation.py"
    - "mypy src/models/feature.py"

# Complex tasks requiring subagents:
Task N (Complex):
  id: "task_complex"
  description: "Design complex integration"
  use_subagent: "system-architect"
  prompt: "Design integration between feature X and Y"

Task N+1 (QA):
  id: "task_qa"
  description: "Comprehensive testing"
  use_subagent: "qa-engineer"
  prompt: "Create and execute comprehensive test suite for feature"

# Continue with atomic, testable tasks...
```

### Per-Task Implementation Guide
```python
# Task 001: Create base data model
# ATOMIC: Only create the model, nothing else
from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Integer
from database import Base

class Feature(Base):
    __tablename__ = "features"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(255), nullable=False)
    # STOP HERE - validation in next iteration

# Task 002: Add validation (NEXT ITERATION)
# Will add pydantic schema and validators
```

## Iteration Validation Protocol

### Pre-Iteration Checks
```bash
# Verify state consistency
cat .state/current_task.txt
cat .state/iteration_count.txt

# Ensure clean working directory
git status
```

### During Iteration Validation
```bash
# Level 1: Immediate Syntax Check (after EVERY file change)
python -m py_compile src/new_file.py

# Level 2: Type Check (after syntax passes)
mypy src/new_file.py --strict

# Level 3: Import Test (after type check passes)
python -c "from src.new_file import ClassName"
```

### Post-Task Validation (REQUIRED before marking complete)
```bash
# Run specific task tests
pytest tests/test_[task_id].py -v --tb=short

# If test fails, DO NOT proceed - fix the code
# If test passes, update state:
echo "task_[ID]" >> .state/completed_tasks.txt
```

### Iteration Exit Criteria
```yaml
PASS:
  - All validation commands execute successfully
  - Test output shows PASSED status
  - No import errors
  - No type errors
  - State files updated
  - No violations of project requirements

FAIL:
  - Fix errors in current iteration
  - Do NOT move to next task
  - Do NOT declare partial success
  - Log specific error for debugging
```

## Anti-Pattern Detection

### Red Flags (STOP if you're doing these)
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Placeholder implementation
def complex_function():
    pass  # TODO: implement later

# ✅ RIGHT: Functional implementation
def complex_function():
    # Actual working code, even if simple
    return process_data(input_data)

# ❌ WRONG: Untested success claim
print("Feature implemented successfully!")

# ❌ WRONG: Untested success claim
console.log("Test passed successfully!")

# ❌ WRONG: Untested success claim
echo "Validated successfully!")

# ✅ RIGHT: Evidence-based completion
# Show actual test output:
# tests/test_feature.py::test_basic PASSED

# ❌ WRONG: Skipping validation
# "Tests would pass if we ran them"

# ✅ RIGHT: Always run validation
subprocess.run(["pytest", "tests/"], check=True)

# ❌ WRONG: Faking results with random()
test_data = hardcoded_constant * Math.random()

# ✅ RIGHT: Always use real data from remote APIs
test_data = remote_api_call()

# ✅ RIGHT: Always use real data from databases.
test_data = fetch_data_from_database()

```

### Oversimplification Triggers
- Replacing error handling with generic try/except
- Using print() instead of proper logging
- Hardcoding values that should be configurable
- Removing functionality to "simplify"
- Creating mock objects instead of real implementations
- Using random() instead of real data
- Doing anything "for now"
- Changing goals to something the user did not explicitly request.

## Final Validation Checklist (Per Iteration)
- [ ] Current task test passes: `pytest tests/test_[task_id].py`
- [ ] No syntax errors: `python -m py_compile [file]`
- [ ] No type errors: `mypy [file]`
- [ ] No import errors: `python -c "import [module]"`
- [ ] State files updated: `.state/` reflects progress
- [ ] No placeholder code remains
- [ ] No untested code paths
- [ ] No randomized fake data
- [ ] No hardcoded fake data

## Emergency Stop Conditions
If ANY of these occur, STOP and ask for user intervention:
1. Test failures after 3 fix attempts
2. Circular dependency detected
3. Breaking changes to existing functionality
4. Security vulnerability introduced
5. Performance regression > 50%
